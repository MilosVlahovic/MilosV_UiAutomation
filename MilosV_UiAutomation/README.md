This project is an automated UI test suite built with C# and Selenium WebDriver, designed to verify core user flows on the XYZ Fashion Store.
 What is covered: User account creation (with random user data), User login (with a predefined valid user), Adding products to the cart (multiple scenarios), UI validation and navigation flow testing.
 The automation framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and easier maintainability.

**Note:** User creation is done with dynamically generated data using a randomizer, login is always performed using a fixed, real user account to maintain consistent validation.
